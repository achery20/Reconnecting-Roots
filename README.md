Alpha Queens of Code, was inspired by the need to provide a platform for African Americans to connect with their ancestry and culture. With the growing interest in genealogy and heritage, we saw an opportunity to create a resource that would allow individuals to explore their roots in a meaningful and impactful way.

As we delved into the project, we learned the importance of understanding one's ancestry for personal growth and development. We also discovered the rich and vibrant culture of the African American community, with its rich history and traditions that have shaped the world as we know it today.

To build this project, We utilized Figma and Canva. We leveraged the existing genetic testing platform provided by 23&me and created an extension that would specifically cater to the needs of African Americans. This allowed us to provide users with a comprehensive and immersive experience, connecting them with their heritage in a way that was both meaningful and impactful.
However, we did face some challenges along the way. The process of creating a platform that would cater to the unique needs of African Americans was not without its difficulties. However, we remained steadfast in our commitment to the project and were determined to overcome any obstacles that arose.

In conclusion, we are proud to present Reconnecting Roots, a platform that will help African Americans connect with their ancestry and culture in a meaningful and impactful way. This project was built with a deep commitment to the African American community, and we hope it will serve as a valuable resource for those looking to explore their roots and learn more about this rich and vibrant culture.
